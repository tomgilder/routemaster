# 0.10.0-dev3

* Made a number of `State` classes private.
* Added: `popUntil` to pop multiple times with a predicate.
* Fixed: when navigating to relative route, use the current context's path as
  the base, instead of the router's current path.

# 0.10.0-dev2

* Added: `TransitionPage` and `TransitionBuilderPage` to make it much easier to
  customize page push and pop animations. 

* Added: private routes - route segments that start with an underscore are not
  shown to the user. For example `/sign-up/_stepTwo` will be displayed as
  `/sign-up` in the address bar, and the user can not navigate to it by URL.

# 0.10.0-dev1

* Added: `StackPage` for navigation stacks without indexed pages

# 0.9.4

* Fixed: an issue where pages were incorrectly rebuilding, causing state such as the active tab to reset

# 0.9.2

* Fixed: navigating to an unknown page on startup could throw an exception

# 0.9.1

* Fixed: issue where `routesBuilder` could be called outside the build phase.

# 0.9.0

* Breaking change: `PageStackNavigator` no longer automatically provides a `HeroController` - to use heroes, wrap the navigator in a `HeroControllerScope`
* Breaking change: refactored `PageWrapper` and `StatefulPage` (this is unlikely to affect you)
* Added a new property to get the current route: `Routemaster.of(context).currentRoute`
* Added documentation to all classes, properties and methods
* Fixed: `RouteData.of(context)` sometimes throwing when navigating away from a page
* Fixed: issue with rebuilding routes when `RoutemasterDelegate` is recreated 
* Fixed: widgets rebuilding when `RoutemasterDelegate` is recreated

# 0.8.0

* Breaking change: `Guard` properties have been renamed: `validate` is now `canNavigate` and `onValidationFailed` is now `onNavigationFailed`
* Breaking change: removed abstract `RouteConfig` class; to create custom routing maps, inherit from `RouteMap`
* Deprecation: `StackNavigator` has been renamed `PageStackNavigator`
* Added `NotFound` return page type
* Added ability to customise the top-level navigator with `RoutemasterDelegate.builder`
* Added ability to use tabs with a custom page type
* Fixed `replace()` not working with hashes on web
* Fixed path URL strategy not working when it's set outside Routemaster 
* Fixed tabs creating a redirect loop on web
* Note: Use of `Guard` is no longer recommended - use standard `if` statements and `NotFound` or `Redirect`

# 0.7.2

* Fixed `pathTemplate` property on `RouteData`

# 0.7.1

* Fixed paths using backslashes on Windows

# 0.7.0

* Breaking change: `RouteData.path` no longer returns the full path with query string, to match Dart's `Uri` object. Use `RouteData.toString()` or `RouteData.fullPath` for the entire path including query string.
* Breaking change: `Guard` now takes a `builder` method instead of a `child` property
* Added support for return values via `pop('Result')`
* Added support for getting the `Route` object when pushing a new path

* Fixed an issue where the controller didn't update when tab length changed

# 0.5.0

* Fixed an issue where the root navigator would rebuild unnecessarily
* Added more useful assert errors
* Added default body for `RoutemasterObserver.didChangeRoute` so you're not forced to override it

# 0.4.0

* Added support for `RoutemasterObserver` in `RoutemasterDelegate`
* Added support for `NavigatorObserver` in `StackNavigator`
* Renamed `tabController` to `controller`

# 0.3.1
